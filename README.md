# Real-space Chemistry on Quantum Computers
This repository is for coding based on the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20583v1. In this paper, a first-quantized, real-space formulations of quantum chemistry on quantum computers are studied. In this paper, Voronoi partition is employed instead of uniform grid.
